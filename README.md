## 👩🏼‍💻 Who am I

Hello there, my name is Daniela Barazarte.

Since I was young I had a big interest in technology, which allowed me to learn more about it as I grew up and come to realization that being a programmer has many thigns that I enjoy such as writing, creating, designing, solving problems and spending a lot of time learning new things.
